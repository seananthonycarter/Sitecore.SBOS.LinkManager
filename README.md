# Sitecore.SBOS.LinkManager 
This module extends the Link Manager to add a capability to set a external link OnClick to trigger a Goal, Page event, and Campaign. This is inspired by a project that targets Sitecore 8.2 https://github.com/raseniero/Sitecore.SBOS.LinkManager/blob/master/Demo.md I have updated it for Sitecore 10 (tested and working on the latest at the time of writing - 10.4) and can be tweaked to target other 10.x versions
