# Sitecore.SBOS.LinkManager 
This module extends the Link Manager to add a capability to set a external link OnClick to trigger a Goal, Page event, and Campaign. This is inspired by a project that targets sitecire 8.2 https://github.com/raseniero/Sitecore.SBOS.LinkManager/blob/master/Demo.md I have updated it for Sietcore 10
